    <h2>1. What My Unfolding Is</h2>
    <p>My Unfolding is a digital journaling tool designed for personal reflection. It is not therapy, medical advice, financial advice, legal counsel, or a substitute for professional support of any kind. Use your own judgment about the insights and patterns generated by the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
    <p>You must be 18 or older to use My Unfolding. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. If you suspect unauthorized access, contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Content</h2>
    <p>Everything you write in My Unfolding belongs to you. We do not claim ownership of your journal entries, intentions, or any other content you create. You grant us a limited license to store and process your content solely to provide the service to you.</p>

    <h2>4. How AI Is Used</h2>
    <p>My Unfolding uses Anthropic's Claude AI for pattern analysis, guided reflection, journal chat, and image transcription. When you use these features, your entries are sent to Anthropic's API for processing. Anthropic does not use your data to train models. We do not store AI-processed content beyond what's needed to display results to you.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>Use My Unfolding for its intended purpose — personal reflection and growth. Do not use the service to generate harmful, abusive, or illegal content. We reserve the right to suspend accounts that violate these terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Availability</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep My Unfolding available at all times but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access. We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time. We will provide reasonable notice of significant changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Payment & Access</h2>
    <p>Access to My Unfolding may be granted through invite codes, coaching partnerships, or paid subscriptions. Specific pricing and refund terms will be communicated at the time of purchase.
