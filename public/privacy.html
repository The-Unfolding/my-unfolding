    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed password. When you use the app, we store your journal entries, intentions, and settings in a secure database (Supabase) linked to your account.</p>

    <h2>How Your Journal Is Stored</h2>
    <p>Your entries are stored in a secure, encrypted database hosted by Supabase. Only you can access your entries through your authenticated account. The Unfolding team does not read your journal entries.</p>

    <h2>How AI Features Work</h2>
    <p>When you use Pattern Analysis, Ask My Journal, Guided Reflection, or Image Transcription, your entries are sent to Anthropic's Claude API for processing. Anthropic processes the data to generate a response and does not store your entries or use them for model training. We send only the minimum data needed for each feature to function.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We do not share your journal entries with third parties. We do not show ads. We do not use your content to train AI models. We do not track you across other websites.</p>

    <h2>Feedback & Communication</h2>
    <p>If you submit feedback through the app, it is sent to our team via email (Resend). Feedback messages do not include your journal entries — only the text you type in the feedback form.</p>

    <h2>Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We use localStorage to keep you signed in, auto-save drafts while you write, and queue entries for sync if you're offline. We do not use tracking cookies or analytics tools.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored for as long as you have an active account. If you delete your account through Settings, all your data — entries, intentions, settings, and your profile — is permanently deleted. This cannot be undone.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use Supabase's built-in security features including encrypted connections, row-level security, and hashed passwords. API routes verify your session token before returning any data. While no system is perfectly secure, we take reasonable measures to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can export your entries at any time using the Print feature. You can delete your entire account and all associated data from the Settings page. If you need help with your data, contact us.</p>
